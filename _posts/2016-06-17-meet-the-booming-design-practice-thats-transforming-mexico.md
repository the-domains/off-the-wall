  Mexico City-based architect Fernando Romero's most recent project isn't a
  building, but a scintillating orb made from thousands of custom-cut crystals.
  Illuminated from within, El Sol, as it's named, features a tessellated surface
  composed of triangular prisms-a nod to the pyramids that were so meaningful to
  Aztec and Mayan culture.
